It has always been my wish to watch movies intently. So that I could effortlessly pick up on subtle details--back stories, easter eggs, and whatnot--without having to watch the movie multiple times. I wanted to be able to see a movie and carefully analyse what made the movie great or horrible. I thought watching a lot of movies would help but I'd usually be disappointed in my eventual movie-critiquing skill. These days, I don't wish for that anymore. I now want to just remember the plot of movies--how they made me feel--and use their stories, graphics, and illustrations as means for empathetic communication. This is what fiction can do, especially film fiction. It is the living playhouse of the imagination. But how can this be done with an SRS system?

And by remember a movie, I mean, talk and describe it as if you watched it yesterday. This is actually impossible but we can come close.

A movie is a 2-hour long video. But to a human that watches movies, a movie is characters and place and plot. We want to remember all 3. How do we remember Character, Place, and Plot? The easiest way to do this is to talk about them a lot. Amongst friends, to strangers, on forums, etc. Talk about them, Fan about them, Preach, Embody them. This advice though is not necessarily efficient and is for people with enough time--basically jobless kids.

I'd use how I mastered the plot of the beautiful beautiful Avatar movie as an example.

#### Remembering the setting for the Avatar (2009) movie
The setting for the Avatar movie is the mystical Pandora Earth.
