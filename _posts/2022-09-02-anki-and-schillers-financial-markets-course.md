Before starting to learn a course or a body of knowledge like say, Cognitive Science; it is best to start out with a goal or with questions in mind.

Initially, you are probably clueless as to what a course is even all about. But you have to start from a space of curiousity before you fill-in the blank space of your cluelessness. The many questions you ask is that curious space.

Questions like;
- Where do banks keep all the cash that I and a thousand other people deposit with them? 
- How does Cash get into these ATM machines? Can they come out forever?
- Why can't I print my own paper money??
- What kind of detergent should I use to launder Money??
- How is it possible that one paper is worth more than another?
- Why must I give you extra money when I return the money I borrowed from you?
