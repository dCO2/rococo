- it is usually the case that when we initially get an idea for something or have first thoughts about a topic, if we don't pay attention to the thought, we most likely will forget about it after a couple of days; as long as the object that inspired the thought is absent.
- this is a normal happening. it is not undesirable. but it is sometimes also desirable to hold on to a thought. Sort of, rooting the thought (or the idea) in the mind once it is birthed.
- SRS systems can be imagined as tools that might make this possible.
- the mental model or metaphor of "planting" is particularly interesting because it is actually impossible to artificially push a thought into the mind (as in the fiction, _Inception_) but the process that comes close to achieving this is one with the technology that affords a repeated gardening/planting of an idea in the mind.
