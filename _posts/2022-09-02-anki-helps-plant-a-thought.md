- It is usually the case that when we initially get an idea for something or have first thoughts about a topic, if we don't pay attention to the thought, we most likely will forget it after a couple of days; as long as the object that inspired the thought is absent.
- This is a normal happening. It is not undesirable. But it is sometimes also desirable to hold on to the thought. Sort of, rooting the thought (or the idea) in the mind once it is birthed.
- SRS systems can be imagined as tools that make this possible.
- The mental model or metaphor of "planting" is particularly interesting because it is actually impossible to artificially push a thought into the mind (as in the fiction, _Inception_) but the process that comes close to achieving this is one with the technology that affords a repeated gardening/planting of the idea in the mind.
