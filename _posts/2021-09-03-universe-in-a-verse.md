I've been trying to understand this idea that reality cannot be described completely with language. And I think understanding a thing is realizing how that thing relates to other things; realizing its connections and the boundaries of its connections.

Although it is possible to describe a video game reality using codes (a type of language), there is a limit to the granularity one can get. Any attempt at zooming in and in and in usually ends up at a blotch of colors on the computer screen.

WIth fractals though, i believe it is possible to continue zooming in and in and in on the reality and the reality never exhausts. It always regenerates but it produces a variation of the same reality, a variation of the same theme. And it is because of this that fractals can be decribed completely by a recurrence formula. You only need clever programming to map that into something visual.

In the objective reality we live and breath in though, the closer we get to zooming into reality, the closer we get to reality's atomos (the photons and quarks and maybe strings?) the more diffcult it is to understand and describe.

And this is what languages do: they categorise things, give names and form to things, things that seem to have some kind of distinct identity: Gold is word for the block of metal that is yellow and shiny and never rusts; Hope is word for that mood of desiring something positive from the future; Faith; the while loop is construct for the inderlying process of returning to the beginning of a set of  instructions; money is word for an object that can be used as a store and unit of the intangible concept "value", the way the inch is a unit for the tangible concept "length of a computer screen."

In all these, the goal is to arrange the universe, to create/fit the universe into our heads. By assigning some specific sound we can make with our mouth to an object in the universe, we can refer to that object without pointing at that object. And by assigning that sound a distinct sequence of symbols, we can refer to that sound without "pointing" at that sound, we can "save" the sound onto a book. And we can replay the sound from the book.

But there are universes where seeing with our the natural power of our senses is impossible: It was impossible to _see_ the earth in its full and glory without the trip to the moon, it was impossible to _see_ electrons without ... . It is impossible to see the universes within ourselves without some kind of probe. 

When i say you can't fit the uinverse into a verse, what i try to say is there is no one sentence that reliably describes that full reality of a situation; there are buts and ifs, conditionals and dependencies; 

When i say "Hey," I do that with a wealth of context that is striped off the shape of the word. When i say "The world is beautiful," I ignore the parts that are probably ugly. When i communicate anything, language is just never enough. We will only approach a picture that resembles truth when we communicate and communicate and commmunicate, understanding the buts and ifs, filling the gaps. And maybe when we have done this for some time, we will get to reach a true theory of everything. Something that is simple and rythmic, something that looks like a verse.
