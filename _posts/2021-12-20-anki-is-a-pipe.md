- I had a habit of creating individual decks for all the various courses I was taking and planning to take.
- I thought doing this would help for when I wanted to focus on one course for a particular day
- I didn't want to encounter cards that were out-of-fit for when I was in a certain mind-context, focused on a specific task or collection of tasks like studying a particular topic or preparing for an interview.
- But this want made me create too many decks that eventually became unwieldy to revise. My decks felt heavy and stale. And my revision sessions got boring.
	- <div style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">It became unwieldy because when I had 6 decks where each deck had 35 _max-new_ cards and 35 _to-be-revised_ cards, then I had to revise, at most, 6 * 70 cards in a day. That's 420 which is too much.</div>
- A better habit I've adopted involves using just one deck for all the courses.
	- This helps make it easier (not unwieldy) to revise the cards because I could set the specific number of _max-new_ cards and 35 _to-be-revised_ cards that wouldn't be too much for a day.
- But even this had focus issues.
	- I still wanted to make my revision topic/date/xyz-specific.
- The approach I having been using to solve this is creating month-separated subdecks within that one superdeck I mentioned earlier.
- This approach helps with focus to an extent
	- I can esaily go to a certain month or group of months to revise the specific things I was learning on that month or group of months.
	- It becomes like a journal. See [Anki as journal]().
- This approach has made me realize that anything that must be put in anki MUST be in a state of flux, must be remembered, must be small, precise. See [Anki is not a bucket, Anki is a pipe]().
