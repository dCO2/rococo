- I had a bad habit of creating individual decks for all the various courses I was taking and planning to take.
- I thought doing this would help for when i wanted to focus on one course for a particular day
- I didnt want to be encounter cards that was usueless for when i will be in a certain mind-context, focued on a select number of things (like during an exam or prearing for an interview: I dont want to see unneccesary cards)
- But this want made me create too many decks that eventually became unwieldy to revise (because for one deck, i had set the max to 35 new and 35 revised cards)
- But this method that im doing now (just one deck for all the courses) helps makes it easier (not unwieldy) to revise the cards
- But even this has focus issues. I still will like to make my revisition topic/date/xyz-specific.
- The approach i having been using for this is creating month-specific subdecks within that one singular superdeck.
- Doing things this way helps with focus to an extent
	- I can esaily go to a certain month or group of months to revise the specific things i was learning on that month or group of months
- This approach has made me see that anything that must be put in anki MUST be in a state of flux, must be remembered, must be small, precise.
- Anki is not a store, it is not a table of content (things like that should go to Obsidian or Notion)
- Topic specific focus:

- Date specific focus:
	- ![[Pasted image 20211220110933.png]]
- I wanted the decks to be a reminder of the things i needed to learn, the things i was learning. But (now that) (if) I remember the few things im interested in (without anki's reminder) I dont need anki to serve that function. I dont need a deck for "Words" because i'd know (it will be a habit) to be on the look out for interesting words and add it to my date-specific superdeck.
- In a sense, because [[habits are autonomous processes you don't think about as if they are easily retrievable from your immediate cloudspace]], if you've not formed an habit (or if the habit is beyond your mental capacity), Anki (or tools and technology in general) could handle that habit for you. But if the habit is within your mental capacity, the time to take out the technology/tool crutch will eventually come.


A bucket is a reference—_i.e._, Textbook, Encyclopedia, Knowledge, "Training". A pipe is a channel—a conduit, a tap, a faucet—that helps control how much conversion—between Knowledge and knowhow—you are doing.
