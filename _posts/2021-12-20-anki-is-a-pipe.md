<ul>
	<li>I had a habit of creating individual decks for all the various courses I was taking and planning to take.</li>
	<li>I thought doing this would help for when I wanted to focus on one course for a particular day</li>
	<li>I didn't want to encounter cards that were out-of-fit for when I was in a certain mind-context, focused on a specific task or collection of tasks like studying a particular topic or preparing for an interview.</li>
	<li>But this want made me create too many decks that eventually became unwieldy to revise. My decks felt heavy and stale. And my revision sessions got boring.</li>
		<ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
			<li>It became unwieldy because when I had 6 decks where each deck had 35 <i>max-new</i> cards and 35 <i>to-be-revised</i> cards, then I had to revise, at most, 6 * 70 cards in a day. That's 420 which is too much.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>A better habit I've adopted involves using just one deck for all the courses.</li>
		<ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
			<li>This helps make it easier (not unwieldy) to revise the cards because I could set the specific number of <i>max-new</i> cards and 35 <i>to-be-revised</i> cards that wouldn't be too much for a day.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>But even this had focus issues.</li>
		<ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
			<li>I still wanted to make my revision topic/date/xyz-specific.</li>
		</ul>		
	<li>The approach I having been using to solve this is creating month-separated subdecks within that one superdeck I mentioned earlier.</li>
	<li>This approach helps with focus to an extent</li>
		<ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
			<li>I still wanted to make my revision topic/date/xyz-specific.</li>
			<li>I can easily go to a certain month to revise the specific things I was learning for that month.</li>
			<li>It becomes like a journal. See <a href="">Anki as journal</a></li>
		</ul>
	<li>This approach has made me realize that anything that must be put in anki MUST be in a state of flux, must be remembered, must be small, precise. See <a href="">Anki is not a bucket, Anki is a pipe</a></li>
</ul>
