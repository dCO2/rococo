- **Here's a problem**: Memory is fallible. But we need to learn and remember. And our learning should acrete. How do we systemize this?

- **Even another:** When you see a work of art stand before you, or you before it, you sometimes marvel at the constellation of processess that made such an object or being or piece of work appear before you in full glory. Everything looks just right, well oiled. The parts seem to flow and glide from one to the next. You see a work of art and want to follow its cadence and flow in your work. How do you do it?

- Maybe you'd sit with your questionâ€”in bed, in the shower, at the yard.
- No one will give you an answer. It is one you have to discover. Poetry.
- The product of the effort of your finding out should be at your fingertips.
- There's a lot of hardwork you don't see.
- And maybe there are two scenarios:
    - You know the answer but the puzzle you solve while writing is one of presentation?
    - You don't know the answer but the writing you do occurs over days, weeks even; and happens in bits: 100 words per day only to record the insights/inspirations you reach daily as you go about your task.
- But then, how do you do this in a way that the insights you see on a daily interacts with what you already know (and have perhaps forgotten)

- These writers seem to have a thousand cameras observing everything. I remember Teju Cole. I remember Anais Nin. How do they do it? How do they recall their experiences from years ago and put in a novel. I remember Vladimir Nabokov. I remember all these people that write memoirs. How do they remember?
- And I see how this relates to other questions and it is this web of questions that make the writing, the essay, the memoir, the journey rich.
- These people observe a lot. They remember because they've formed a web of observations, questions and answers in their heads. Every question hangs on every other question. And the fact is, they discover what they never knew they knew as they write. It makes you more observant. Why?
- Roth: Everything that happens to you is material.
- Most times these people have worked a lot on that problem. Thought a lot about it too. Sometimes they think about just one thing (like ...) or 6 thinks (like Feynman in the shower, in bed when... )
- But how do you do it when you have a thousand things to think about. And you cannot seem to keep track of everything? 
- Rilke: Everything is gestation.
- Everything is evolution. But if you don't keep track of the evolution of a thought, I don't want to believe that thought will evolve at all. It might be one you're constatly thinking about but what if other more important thoughts must take the stage?  
<br>
- There is something you want to say but you don't know how to say it. It doesn't have much breadth. It is just a tiny tinie observation but you know it will capture the essence of what it is you observe. So you put it in a poem. 
- We love the concrete more than the abstract. We want to make things as tangible as possible.
- I think about one thing for a week and I put it out there. To forget it. Yes, I  write to forget. So new evolutions can happen once I've forgotten the restricting details of the essay. Fallow.
<br>
- It is while you write that beautiful unexpected things jump out at you. As you read, you are not expecting those things because, well you read those things; because they are at the edge of your understanding anyway. So you don't know what to expect and more fun if the writer does his job of writing and explaining well.
- You really do think while you write. But it is all jumbled. Writing is the presentation of that jumble and presentation should be beautful. The presentaion also somehow prunes the underlying jumble of knowledge, making it better patterned.
- Now you get to look at presentation/appearances even more, you observe it closely, understand what about it you might be missing.
