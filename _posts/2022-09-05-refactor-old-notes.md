- Big notes violate the guiding principle that notes should actually be atomic. (See [Notes should be atomic](/2022/09/02/a-note-should-be-atomic))
    - Notes should not contain sets of information.
    - If not, they become difficult to revise and then, boring
    - Eventually, the big notes become stale.
- Stale notes on the hand, violate the guiding principle that notes should be in motion.
- What you want to do is creatively split the note into smaller revisible bits. If this is not possible, then delete it.
