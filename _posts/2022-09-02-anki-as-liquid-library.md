- _liquid library_ is fancy phrase for describing a library where all the books on display at a bookshelf changes daily.
- a book, in a liquid library, is a collection of many linked atomic notes--a collection of many prompts
    - such that basic and fundamental notes are memorable and linked to many notes in a network forming the network's root and also moving less frequently into your attention space.
- the library, then, is a network of network of notes--where the notes move into your attention space at a speed depending on how well you remember it.
