- When you [refactor old notes](/2022/09/05/refactor-old-notes), what do you do with them if you actually create many new notes that eventually replace the old one?
    - At this point, the old notes are infrequent and so if you see them during a review session, it will take a long while before you see them again.
- What you could do is create the many notes gradually and hit the `Again` button that makes the note more frequent in your current attention space.
