_Silence of the Sea_ by Bang Hai Ja, 2005

## Intro
I began working more actively on ways to improve my memory when I realized that I could not learn anything properly and longterm without a kind of external structure--somewhere to "put" the many things I was trying to learn; something to help revisit all the many things I was trying to learn...

## Brief History of Memory Augmentation

The history of improving memory with technology goes back a long way. From Douglas Engelbart \[in [Augmenting Human Intellect](http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Engelbart1962.pdf) (1962)\] to Ted Nelson in \[[Complex information processing: a file structure for the complex, the changing and the indeterminate](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806036) (1965)\] to Tim Berners-Lee \[in [Information Management: a Proposal](https://w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html) (1989)\] to Piotr Wozniak and so on. But I won't discuss all that here. Only the actionable stuff.

## <a href="/2022/08/17/project-mnemosyne#-list-of-content">How I use Anki</a>

Anki is a software that, based on the [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) learning technique, helps you schedule learning tasks. Anki is basically a todo-app on steriods. But this is an oversimplification. There are many technologies that could be organically designed to help do this in effective and novel ways.

When you newly install the Anki software, this is what you see:

The decks (in the image above, there is one deck and it is the ‘default’ deck) are like folders you use to separate groups of notes.

But this is the current look of my Anki decks after 1+ year of many organic changes. It has become stable for now.
![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/367dd7e5-c82c-402f-8ef7-4b9a2637e8a5_1920x1050.jpeg)

I find that, on one level, separating decks into ‘_Buffer_’ and ‘_Limbo_’ helps differentiate the nature of things I'm learning. I named the first '_Buffer_' because the deck represents the group of notes I made for things I'm currently learning. '_Limbo_' on the other hand represents the group of things I plan on—but haven't started—learning. The separation is important because Anki (and other space repetition softwares) are essentially _a stream of urgent todo_s (editorial text: clickable link to an Obsidian note). It is a stream because the various notes are always systematically moved into my attention-space. But Limbo is where nothing happens. The notes there are not yet in my attention space.

The subdecks in the Buffer deck are separated by months because that way, I can decide to focus on just the notes I created when I learnt a specific thing for that month. It is also like a journal. I can reimagine the headspace I was in that month.

I could go on and give step by step instructions on how to create decks (and so on) but that's ineffective. There is an online [Anki manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/) that documents how to use Anki in detail. What I'd do is give you hints on how best to create a question/answer note and how best to organize your Anki deck.

This is what a note actually looks like in preview:

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/833869a3-baf4-4641-9fbc-44030f8a8a3a_797x675.png)

A note is basically a question/answer pair. It is that simple. But it is important that it should be that simple. This question (or note) is from May 2021. And the answer is on the “back-side” as shown in the following picture.

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e72169a7-253e-4c7f-8254-0d8318d80659_797x671.png)

I have deliberately designed the answer to appear along-side the question (which is blurred) just beneath it. But it is still the “back-side”.

This is another note but it is a bad note because the question is poorly asked.

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f2cae03e-1c70-4d83-ada7-e336b6bf7ae9_799x669.png)

This is also a bad note because not enough context was given:

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b28a70a-33ed-44e8-ada1-5709d6655f7e_797x666.png)

The following notes are more recent and are properly asked. They could range from many various topics. _Some of the notes (read: question) are shown with their answers underneath._

A bunch of attempts at using Anki for random stuff:

#### Using Anki to gain self-knowledge

Using Anki to remember questions to yourself you might answer in the future

#### Using Anki to read books

#### Using Anki to read articles

#### Using Anki to learn history

#### Using Anki to learn novels/stories

#### Using Anki to learn a language

#### Using Anki to learn drawing, music, music theory.

#### Using Anki to read the news

#### Using Anki to watch youtube videos

### philosophy-ish talking points
