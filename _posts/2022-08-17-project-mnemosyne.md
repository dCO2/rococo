## <a href="/2022/08/17/project-mnemosyne#" style="text-decoration: none;">1. Intro</a>
I began actively working on ways to improve my memory when I realized I could not learn anything properly and longterm without a kind of external structure--somewhere to "put" the many concepts I was learning, and something to help revisit them. The precise history of events escape me but reading <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/">Andy Matuschak's article</a> inspired me to actually begin work on the project I had been postponing.

The idea of human memory augmentation is a very broad and interesting one. Methods for improving memory can be medical as in with the use of [Nootropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic). Or creative as in with the use of Mnemonics. Or even technological as in with the use of systems that afford spaced repetition. The methods are various and the history is rich.

The history of improving memory with technology goes back a long way. From Douglas Engelbart in [Augmenting Human Intellect](http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Engelbart1962.pdf) (1962) to Ted Nelson in [Complex information processing: a file structure for the complex, the changing and the indeterminate](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806036) (1965) to Tim Berners-Lee in [Information Management: a Proposal](https://w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html) (1989) to Piotr Wozniak and so on. If interested in this history, read Michael Nielsen's big and brilliant article, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-term Memory</a>.

### What is Spaced Repetition?

## <a href="/2022/08/17/project-mnemosyne#" style="text-decoration: none;">2. How I use Anki</a>

Anki is a software that, based on the [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) learning technique, helps you schedule learning tasks. Anki is basically a todo-app on steriods. But this is an oversimplification. There are many technologies that could be organically designed to help do this in effective and novel ways.

When you newly install the Anki software, this is what you see:

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eb7a28c3-6310-4dee-a3dd-1d45ba1f62ca_1920x1048.jpeg)

The decks (in the image above, there is one deck and it is the ‘default’ deck) are like folders you use to separate groups of notes.

But this is the current look of my Anki decks after 1+ year of many organic changes. It has become stable for now.
![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/367dd7e5-c82c-402f-8ef7-4b9a2637e8a5_1920x1050.jpeg)

I find that, on one level, separating decks into ‘_Buffer_’ and ‘_Limbo_’ helps differentiate the nature of things I'm learning. I named the first '_Buffer_' because the deck represents the group of notes I made for things I'm currently learning. '_Limbo_' on the other hand represents the group of things I plan on—but haven't started—learning. The separation is important because Anki (and other space repetition softwares) are essentially _a stream of urgent todo_s (editorial text: clickable link to an Obsidian note). It is a stream because the various notes are always systematically moved into my attention-space. But Limbo is where nothing happens. The notes there are not yet in my attention space.

The subdecks in the Buffer deck are separated by months because that way, I can decide to focus on just the notes I created when I learnt a specific thing for that month. It is also like a journal. I can reimagine the headspace I was in that month.

I could go on and give step by step instructions on how to create decks (and so on) but that's ineffective. There is an online [Anki manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/) that documents how to use Anki in detail. What I'd do is give you hints on how best to create a question/answer note and how best to organize your Anki deck.

This is what a note actually looks like in preview:

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/833869a3-baf4-4641-9fbc-44030f8a8a3a_797x675.png)

A note is basically a question/answer pair. It is that simple. But it is important that it should be that simple. This question (or note) is from May 2021. And the answer is on the “back-side” as shown in the following picture.

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e72169a7-253e-4c7f-8254-0d8318d80659_797x671.png)

I have deliberately designed the answer to appear along-side the question (which is blurred) just beneath it. But it is still the “back-side”.

This is another note but it is a bad note because the question is poorly asked.

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f2cae03e-1c70-4d83-ada7-e336b6bf7ae9_799x669.png)

This is also a bad note because not enough context was given:

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b28a70a-33ed-44e8-ada1-5709d6655f7e_797x666.png)

The following notes are more recent and are properly asked. They could range from many various topics. _Some of the notes (read: question) are shown with their answers underneath._

## 3. Principles for writing good prompts and organizing Anki decks
- [Anki helps you plant a thought](),
- [Anki as catalyst for habitual thought](), 
- [Anki as stream of urgent todos](), 
- [Anki is a bucket, not a pipe](),
- [Anki as hook for scaling steep learning curves]().
- [Anki as journal]()

## 4. Attempts at using Anki for random stuff

### Using Anki to gain self-knowledge
Using Anki to remember questions to yourself you might answer in the future
### Using Anki to learn movement and exercises
### Using Anki to read books
### Using Anki to read articles
### Using Anki to learn history
### Using Anki to learn novels/stories
### Using Anki to learn a language
### Using Anki to learn drawing, music, music theory.
### Using Anki to watch youtube videos


## 5. Miscellaneous notes
- [Anki vs. Readwise]()
- [Anki laziness]()
- [interacting with anki automatically schedules the hierarchy of difficulty when learning a linear course]()
- [create notes in anki first before refactoring them into obsidian when doing light/new research]()
- [create notes in obsidian first before refactoring them into anki when doing heavy/old research]()
