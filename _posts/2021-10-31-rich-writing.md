How do you even do this: Writing about/presenting your process of coming at an answer to a question? In a way that's interesting? How do you even assemble the unchronological memory of the process into something that is paragraph-by-paragraph readable?

Well. Everything is an experiment. So there could be one question for the week. One question that undergirds the flow of the million other things you do daily (Monster stalking in the dark alley beside).

I find it serendipitous to direct your attention like this. Amidst the borage of experiences you go through, you try to sift them, you try to force them into another context, the context of your question, you force your thinking into new perspectives, to understand something new. Something different. Everything serves your question. You see everything through one lens. Yes. I like directing my attention like this. Is this how a writing becomes rich and wondrous? Maybe.

We don't want to take "Just practice and you'd be good at this" as an answer to the question. You see, that's the art of the Personal Essay. You get to embellish your answers with as much context as possible. Make things tangible. "Practice" is personality abstracted away. It is dead.  
  
It seems like I'm telling you stuff, telling you facts. But I'm really not. These are my factual fancies maybe. _Nabokov:_
> "There's no art without facts, No science without fancy."

Loops and channels. Streams. Routines. Ritual. That don't have to take up too much of your attention. It just happens. Order comes eventually.

- You don't know But it's wondrous and you want to know and you know how.  
- you don't know but it's wondrous and you know you will never know. And it remains wondrous.  
- you don't know but it's not wondrous but you want to know.  
- etc.

What questions will I be asking? With be a background in math and physics and computer science and electronics & software engineering, philosophy and economics? I wanted to add Poetry but poetry is not a discipline. Poetry is a tool.... Icing on the cake. It is what you use when you want to aggregate a beautifully nuanced "broth" of these different "fields"... "From delight to wisdom" as Frost said.
