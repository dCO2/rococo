Learning is pretty easy. I guess we all know the magic for that; stick with whatever you want to learn for long enough and somehow, it gradually becomes a part of you. Is it math or the martial arts you need to learn? Eventually, they both become a part of your mental or muscle memory.
The crux of the magic here is: stick with it for long enough. We don't know the details of that magic, we don't know exactly why it works but we know it does work.
Curiously, there is a problem with this magic; It is not practical. It assumes that we are all robots with zero-commitment issues; that we will return and return to that one thing we want to learn.
But effort is finite. We cant always spread ourselves and our attention thing over a broad range of things.
