_Three Wise Men_ by Jimoh Buraimoh, 1991

- Why learn Algorithm design?
- Write down your thought process when thinking about a solution for problems.
  - Leetcode 985, [Sum Of Even Numbers After Queries](/2022/09/21/sum-of-even-number-after-queries).
- See [Using Anki to think about algorithm design problems]().
  - [are you not cramming code?]()---Oh no, actually not.
- Algorithms that easily become a part of you (because they are simple? or their problem statement is straightforward? or the solution is memorable?)
  - Linked List: "_Design an algorithm that, given a pointer to the head of a linked list, returns a pointer to the element at the middle of the list_", [Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)
  - Bit-shifting, Adhoc: "_Design an algorithm that, given a non-empty array of integers where every integer appears twice except for one integer, returns the value of that one integer_", [Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)
  - Breadth-first search
  - Depth-first search
- Restate problem statement for algorithms in your own words (i.e., compress them)
  - For example, despite the long plot for the problem in [Leetcode 198 - House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/), the task is basically to _design an algorithm that makes a selection of numbers in an array such that the sum of the selected numbers is maximum but adjacent numbers cannot be selected_.
  - A compressed statement then is; _select maximum sum of non-adjacent numbers from given array_.
