- In order to use [SRS systems as a library](/2022/09/02/anki-as-liquid-library), that is, as a "place" with pools of ordered information, it must be possible to retrieve all the network of related notes for a topic at once.
- The only way to do this in the Anki SRS system is with the use of tags.
- If a note is about, say algorithm design, then all similar notes (on algorithm design) should be linked to that one note.
- This linking is done with tags in Anki.
