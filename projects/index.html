<i>What type of Projects are on this page?</i> I particularly like the idea of 'project' <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv">Visakanv<a/> hints at <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1057601229394591745?s=20&t=U_83Cvx5MUaMFPRuQlgz_Q">when he describes</a> the skill of 'project management'. A project is any venture from writing a poem to writing an anthology or anything from writing a python script to building Cassandra—all require some kind of effortful management. Anyway, the projects here won't be about poetry but software engineering and productivity. These projects will be tagged '<b>#coding</b>' or '<b>#utility</b>'
