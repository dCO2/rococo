  <p><em>Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! is the buzzing sound of depression in our modern time. What Frankensteined this Monster?</em> <br /></p>

<h2 id="but-first-how-depression">but first, <em>How depression</em>?</h2>

<p>Depression is a 16-feet tall monster; large and menacing that anyone or anything beside it becomes—like an insect—insignificantly irrelevant. If you are unfortunate to be captured by this monster, He grabs yne that, please imagine it even more spread out and total. Imagine that every cell in your bo by bursting involuntarily into tears and telling them that she knew all too well that she was one of those dreaded types of everyone’s grim acquaintance who call at inconvenient times and just go on and on about themselves.”</p>

<p>Language can communicate only so much, something that is entirely subjective. Depression is a disorder. It is also a mood which is often sadness that wears off after a few days. As a disorder, it is something much worse. Something that feels perpetual only made mild with antidepressants.</p>

<h2 id="then-why-depression">then, <em>Why depression</em>?</h2>

<p>To attempt to understand the causes of depression locally, i.e, by studying the source of depression in an individual, we hit a hard wall because depression—in a sense—is sadness that has forgotten its true causes – forgotten because remembering may generate overwhelming, untenable feelings of pain and loss. A better approach will be to understand its causes globally. Why depression? Isn individualistic society advocates that everyone is capable of a special destiny; that the eel the twitch of the exposed muscle and the heat of the blood on my cheek, all the time. But when I’d say to a doctor or to Mom or to other people, “Hey, look at this open wound on my face, I’d better go to the hospital,” they’d say, “Well, hey, there’s no wound on your face, are your eyes OK?”…_”</p>

<p>We may not know exactly what fueled the sad suicide story of Professor David Foster Wallace. It could have been his genes. It could have been the society he found himself in. We are just not sure. What we do know is that our Society and Modernity is to blame for the larger accounts of clinical depression. Our Society Frankensteined this Monster with 6 body parts and strange chemicals: a face and head of The Media; a torso of Individualism; two arms of Meritocracy and Secularism; two Legs of Perfectibilty and Romanticism all pounding and pounding and pounding; stomping and stomping and stomping: A never-ending buzz of pain…</p>
