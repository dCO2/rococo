- I'm Caleb. I work as a Software Engineer. And sometimes a faux essayist too.
- I work on _Memory_, _Optimization_, _Data_, and _Networked_ systems (\\(modN\\) systems! Haha. _read: "modern systems"_)
- I write essays around business, software engineering, economics, and the philosophy of memory.
- I'm interested in building systems that optimize learning and [expand what people can think and do.](https://andymatuschak.org/)
