<h1 style="background-color: #00ffef40;display: inline;"><em>Helloâ€”</em></h1>

- I'm Caleb. I work as a Software Engineer. And sometimes an essayist too.
- I work on _Data_, and _Front-end_ systems.
- I write essays around software engineering and tech.
- I'm interested in building tools that optimize learning and [expand what people can think and do](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

<h3 style="background-color: #00ffef40;display: inline;"><em>Welcome!</em></h3>

You can find a selection of my projects [here](/projects/). I keep track of book-notes for a few of the books and articles I read [here](/booknotes/); sometimes I try to flesh-out my thinking into essays, you can find them [here](/essays/). In the spirit of "[working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up)," [here](/notes/) is my (slapdash) public notebook. And my resume! _(This website is a work-in-progress)_
