<h1 style="background-color: #00ffef40;display: inline;"><em>Hello‚Äî</em></h1>

- I'm Caleb. I work as a Software Engineer. And sometimes a faux essayist too.
- I work on _Memory_, _Optimization_, _Data_, and _Networked_ systems (\\(modN\\) systems! Haha. _Read: "modern systems"_)
- I write essays around business, software engineering, economics, and the philosophy of memory.
- I'm interested in building tools that optimize learning and [expand what people can think and do](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

<h3 style="background-color: #00ffef40;display: inline;"><em>Welcome!</em></h3>

You can find a selection of my <span style="background-color: #00ffef40;display: inline;"><a href="/projects/">projects</a></span> [here](/projects/). I keep track of notes for a few of the books and articles I read [here](/booknotes/); sometimes I try to flesh-out my thinking into essays, you can find them [here](/essays/). In the spirit of "[working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up)," [here](/notes/) is my most-times scrappy, difficult-to-understand public notebook. And [my resume](/resume.pdf/)!
